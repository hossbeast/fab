WINDOW


MAP/REDUCE/AGGREGATE - combine selected entries

 (map) - create groups which will be reduced separately (grouped selection - otherwise the entire selection is reduced at once)

reduce operators take an expression referring to window segments, then compute

 xsum/sum/avg/min/max/cnt - 1 result row (per group)

 e - printf expression - preserve rows, directives available for aggregates on the set

LOCKING
 k (lock) - associate elements in the top list with elements in following lists. Then movements (sorting) is mirrored into the sublist(s) on the joins

** NAMING RATIONALE **

when two operators perform similar functions, they share the same core name. The position of the differentiating characters characterizes
their difference

 l   - locate (strings)
 lx  - locate (filename extension)
