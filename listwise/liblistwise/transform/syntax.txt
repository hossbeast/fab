1) what is the delimiter
2) are backslash-escapes enabled

default : !\/ # 1=/, 2=yes

scanning mode can be changed in place - i.e. the same string may be scanned using different modes
 the tokens are concatenated in the parser

for a regex string, you want backslash escaping OFF, so that the RE engine can handle backslashes
for a replacement string, you want backslash ON, so that the replacement string can contain backreferences and hexreferences
