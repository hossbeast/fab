WINDOW

: all windows are reset at the end of lstack_exec
: rename h -> w "select a window of entries"
: rename j -> "meld" (join is reserved for the aggregate api)
: get rid of OBJECT_NO, and there is no WINDOW_NO
: existing operators should be declared listwise/builtin_operators.h
: window-manipulation operators will update the last-set
: remove snm/snw/ssm/ssw

window-manipulation operators
 wm  - window regex-matches (first, global)
 wc  - window offset/length - chars
 wfs - window offset/length - fields (string delimited)
 wfm - window offset/length - fields (regex delimited)
 wv  - invert window
 wvf - set window to following
 wvp - set window to preceeding
 wz  - reset window

the immediately following window-manipulation operator is cumulative, rather than overwrite
 o - 

window-consumption operators
 x  - e(X)tract window - replace entry with its window
 t  - (T)ear windowed segments into new entries

MAP/REDUCE/AGGREGATE - combine selected entries

 j (join/map/group) - create groups which will be reduced separately (partitioned selection - otherwise the entire selection is reduced at once)

reduce operators take an expression referring to window segments, then compute

 xsum/sum/avg/min/max/cnt - 1 result row (per partition)

 e - printf expression - preserve rows, directives available for aggregates on the set
