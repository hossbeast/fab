WINDOW

: existing operators should be declared listwise/builtin_operators.h
: c -> m (merge)
: j -> c (concatenate)
: g -> 

window-manipulation operators
 m   - window regex-matches (first, global)									re
 c   - window offset/length - chars													f
 fs  - window offset/length - fields (string delimited)			l/f
 fm  - window offset/length - fields (regex delimited)			re/f
 wv  - invert window
 wvf - set window to following
 wvp - set window to preceeding
 wz  - reset window

the immediately following window-manipulation operator is cumulative, rather than overwrite
 o - 

window-consumption operators
 t  - (T)ear windowed segments into new entries

MAP/REDUCE/AGGREGATE - combine selected entries

 g (group) - create groups which will be reduced separately (grouped selection - otherwise the entire selection is reduced at once)

reduce operators take an expression referring to window segments, then compute

 xsum/sum/avg/min/max/cnt - 1 result row (per group)

 e - printf expression - preserve rows, directives available for aggregates on the set

LOCKING
 j (join) - associate elements in the top list with elements in following lists. Then movements (sorting) is mirrored into the sublist(s) on the joins
