WINDOW

: existing operators should be declared listwise/builtin_operators.h

window-manipulation operators
 vw  - invert window
 vfw - set window to following
 vpw - set window to preceeding
 zw  - reset window

window-consumption operators
 t  - (T)ear windowed segments into new entries

MAP/REDUCE/AGGREGATE - combine selected entries

 m (map) - create groups which will be reduced separately (grouped selection - otherwise the entire selection is reduced at once)

reduce operators take an expression referring to window segments, then compute

 xsum/sum/avg/min/max/cnt - 1 result row (per group)

 e - printf expression - preserve rows, directives available for aggregates on the set

LOCKING
 k (lock) - associate elements in the top list with elements in following lists. Then movements (sorting) is mirrored into the sublist(s) on the joins


** NAMING RATIONALE **

when two operators perform similar functions, they share the same core name. The position of the differentiating characters characterizes
their difference

after : modified operation
 l   - locate (strings)
 lx  - locate (filename extension)
 s   - substitution (by regex)
 sx  - substitution (by filename extension)

before : the same operation but applied to another area of liblistwise functionality
 z  - reset selection
 wz - reset window
 v  - invert selection
 wv - invert window
