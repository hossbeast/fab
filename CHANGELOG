v0.6.0 - May 2020

The v0.6 release represents a rewrite of most of the functionality of the
project. It is NOT backwards compatible with the v0.5 series. To upgrade, you
will have to replace fabfiles with module.bam files which have an entirely
different syntax.

v0.5.4.0 - July 2018

The v0.5 branch is used to build the master branch. This release is aimed at
making it easier to set up a new environment for building the master branch. In
particular the fab build logic should not rely on modules provided by the
previous version.

* clean up some compile time errors and warnings to permit building with newer
  compilers
* add an option to allow specifying directories for resolving invocations with
  higher precedence than the builtin directories provided by fab
