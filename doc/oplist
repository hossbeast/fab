s       Substitution
w       window (on each string)

inplace filesystem/path operators
rp      path canonicalization (with RealPath)
bn      basename
dn      dirname

interlist operators

ss      Sort Strings (asc)
sn      Sort Numeric (asc)

implementation operators
o       Or - 
y       apply items affected by last operator to selection

// TODO 
// n     select by Number 
//       select by expression on x (every other, etc) 
// y     transliteration 
// wl    window of strings in the list  
// st    stat each path, printf(fmt) with results (like find printf) 
// jw    join lists - window  
// jm		 join lists - regex 
//       (set) intersect - jw on whole string 
//       (set) union - same as c 
// ext   file name extension 
//       replace bn/dp with window on '/' delimited sections 

// append text to each entry
// prepend text to each entry

// apply the following operation to all lists on the stack
// apply previous operation to all lists on the stack

// select previous  - all rows up to and including the last selected row 
// select following - all rows including and following the last selected row 
// split lines
   like disjoin, where the number of elements in list[0] is equal to the number of matches in all the
   text comprising the current selection 

// establish selections on each entry
//  by offset/length window
//  by regex-match window
// THEN
//  aggregate math operations
//   sum/avg/stddev - push, write 1 entry with results
//  sort lines based on value in window
//  splice - remove window
//  extract - invert, remove window(s)
