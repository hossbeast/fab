# tagging of items in fabfile for logging - the tagging is done with per-node ( x:y ) settings
  per-node settings ( x:y, x:y )
		invalidate this node
		dump individual VAR-sets by name
		dump individual formulas by node-name

# PERSISTENT FAB DAEMON FOR A GIVEN TARGET
	given a target, establishes inotify watches on all relevant nodes
	given any changes, performs builds necessary to reconstruct the target
	outputs say a 10-line HUD view of current activity
		suitable for tailing - it emits say 10 newlines between views
	you can query the FABD for dumping node information it knows about
	affecting fabfile changes - equivalent to restarting the daemon

# autovar documentation
$@, ${products} - products of the current formula
$<, ${lhs}      - lefthand side of a multi-product formula
$#, ${initdir}  - relative path to the directory containing the master fabfile
$*, ${thisdir}	- relative path to the directory containing the current fabfile
