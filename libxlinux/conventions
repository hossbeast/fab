in all cases, if the return value of the underlying function may be useful to the
caller, it is returned via the final parameter to the wrapper/proxy

if a function has both a TYPE and OPERATION modifier, the OPERATION modifier is first

TYPE
----
w<function>
 non-xapi wrapper function that follows the zero-return-success model and fails exactly
 when the underlying function fails

x<function>
 xapi-enabled proxy function that invokes fail on failure in exactly the same cases when
 the underlying function fails

OPERATION
---------
i<function> (idempotent)
 accepts a pointer to an identifier to some resource and, upon successful completion, sets
 the value pointed to to the identity value for that resource type

u<function> (union)
 fails only in some subset of failure cases of the underlying function as specified

a<function>
 fails in some superset of failure cases of the underlying function as specified

e<function> (extended)
 performs the same operation as the underlying function on another data type

o<function>
