in all cases, if the return value of the underlying function may be useful to the
caller, it is returned via the final parameter to the wrapper/proxy

if a function has both a TYPE and OPERATION modifier, the OPERATION modifier is first

fname
  : OPERATIONs TYPE name
  | OPERATIONs name
  | TYPE name
  
OPERATION
  : i 
  | u
  | a
  | e

TYPE
  : w
  | x

TYPE
----
w (wrapper)
 non-xapi wrapper function that follows the zero-return-success model and fails exactly
 when the underlying function fails

x (xapi)
 xapi-enabled proxy function that fails in exactly the same cases as the underlying function

OPERATION
---------
i (idempotent)
 accepts a pointer to an identifier to some resource and, upon successful completion, sets
 the value pointed to to the identity value for that resource type

u (union)
 fails only in some subset of failure cases of the underlying function as specified

a (also)
 fails in some superset of failure cases of the underlying function as specified

e (extended)
 performs the same operation as the underlying function on another data type
