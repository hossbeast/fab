v0.5.4.0

The v0.5 branch is used to build the master branch. This release is aimed at
making it easier to set up a new environment for building the master branch. In
particular the fab build logic should not rely on modules provided by the
previous version.

* clean up some compile time errors and warnings to permit building with newer
  compilers
* add an option to allow specifying directories for resolving invocations with
  higher precedence than the builtin directories provided by fab
